I am a recent\n            graduate of the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at the University of\n            Texas at Austin. I have experience in languages such as HTML,\n            React.js and Bootstrap to build applications such as the one your\n            viewing right now! I have been coding for about 1 year now and have\n            been doing many personal and educational projects to fine tune my\n            skills as a developer. Aside from coding, I love to spend my time\n            with hobbies of mine like tinkering with my computer as well as\n            other electronics. I am also a dedicated musician. I play a variety\n            of instruments such as trumpet, saxphone, piano and guitar. Lastly,\n            my one true love is Video Games. I enjoy logging on and spending\n            time with my friends on a good gaming session that may last for\n            hours. All in all I am a very busy person. I like to fill my days\n            with as many activities as possible all while becoming a better\n            developer. */}\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
